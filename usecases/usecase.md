**The problem** is how to prove effeciently the authenticity of art works(objects)! in case the piece of art exchanged private hands there are likely gaps in the supporting document proofs.

Currently different approaches are used including Comparative techniques, expert opinions, and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of _**documentation**_.

**Provenance** is conceptually comparable to the legal term _**chain of custody**_ providing the chronology of the ownership, custody, or location of a historical object
